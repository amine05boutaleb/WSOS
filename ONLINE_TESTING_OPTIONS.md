# Online Testing Options for WSOS

## Summary: No Perfect Online Solution

Unfortunately, there's no single online tool that can compile and run this OS project completely. However, here are your best options ranked:

---

## ‚≠ê Best Option: GitHub Codespaces (Recommended)

**Pros:**
- Full Linux environment in browser
- All tools available (GCC, NASM, Make, Bochs)
- Can build and test completely online
- Free tier: 60 hours/month

**Cons:**
- Requires GitHub account
- Bochs GUI won't work (text output only)

### Steps:

1. **Create GitHub Account** (if you don't have one)
   - Go to: https://github.com/signup

2. **Create New Repository**
   - Click "New" repository
   - Name it: `WSOS`
   - Make it private or public
   - Don't initialize with README

3. **Upload Your Code**
   ```bash
   # On your local machine, in your WSOS directory
   cd "C:\Users\AmineBOUTALEB\Downloads\project 3\WSOS"
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/WSOS.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

4. **Open in Codespaces**
   - Go to your GitHub repository
   - Click the green "Code" button
   - Select "Codespaces" tab
   - Click "Create codespace on main"

5. **Install Dependencies** (in Codespaces terminal)
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install -y nasm gcc-multilib make bochs
   ```

6. **Build and Run**
   ```bash
   cd OS
   make clean
   make

   # Run Bochs in text mode
   bochs -f bochsrc.bxrc -q
   ```

7. **View Output**
   - You'll see text output in the terminal
   - Look for: **ABCDEBCDECDC**

## Option 2: Replit (Build Only)

**Pros:**
- No account required (or free account)
- Easy to use
- Can build the project

**Cons:**
- Can't run Bochs
- Can only verify compilation works

### Steps:

1. **Go to Replit**: https://replit.com/

2. **Create New Repl**
   - Click "Create Repl"
   - Choose "C++"
   - Name it "WSOS"

3. **Upload Files**
   - Use the file upload button to upload your OS directory

4. **Install NASM** (in Shell)
   ```bash
   # Check if NASM is available
   nasm --version

   # If not, you may need to install it (may require pro account)
   ```

5. **Build**
   ```bash
   cd OS
   make
   ```

6. **Limitation**: You can verify the build works, but can't run/test it

---

## Option 3: Copy.sh v86 Emulator

**Pros:**
- Runs x86 code in browser
- Can boot from floppy images
- No account needed

**Cons:**
- You must build `os.img` locally first
- Upload interface is limited

### Steps:

1. **Build Locally** (requires local tools)
   ```bash
   cd "C:\Users\AmineBOUTALEB\Downloads\project 3\WSOS\OS"
   make
   ```

2. **Go to**: https://copy.sh/v86/

3. **Click "Choose your own"**

4. **Upload your `os.img`** from `OS/build/os.img`

5. **Boot Settings**:
   - Set as floppy disk
   - Boot from floppy

**Note**: This emulator may or may not work with your specific bootloader. It's experimental.

---

## Option 4: OnlineGDB (Very Limited)

**URL**: https://www.onlinegdb.com/

**Why it won't work:**
- No NASM support
- No custom bootloader support
- Only runs standard C programs
- ‚ùå **Verdict**: Don't use for this project

---

## üèÜ My Recommendation

### For Complete Testing: **GitHub Codespaces**

1. Create free GitHub account
2. Push code to GitHub
3. Open Codespaces
4. Install tools (one-time setup)
5. Build and run completely online

### For Quick Verification: **WSL2 (on your Windows machine)**

This is technically "local" but:
- Installs in 5 minutes
- Uses Linux tools natively
- Can access your Windows files
- No separate VM needed
- Works perfectly with Bochs

**WSL2 Setup (5 minutes):**
```powershell
# In PowerShell as Administrator
wsl --install

# Restart computer

# Open "Ubuntu" from Start Menu

# Install everything
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y build-essential nasm bochs

# Build and test
cd "/mnt/c/Users/AmineBOUTALEB/Downloads/project 3/WSOS/OS"
make clean && make
bochs -f bochsrc.bxrc -q
```

## What I Recommend You Do

### Fastest Path to Testing:

**Option A: Install WSL2** (5 minutes setup, perfect results)
- One-time 5-minute install
- Full Linux environment in Windows
- All tools work perfectly
- Can see graphical output with X server (optional)

**Option B: Use GitHub Codespaces** (10 minutes setup, text output only)
- Completely online
- Free 60 hours/month
- No installation on your machine
- Text-based output (still shows ABCDEBCDECDC)

---

## Need Help Choosing?

**If you want the easiest solution**: WSL2 (5 min setup, works perfectly)

**If you absolutely must test online**: GitHub Codespaces (requires GitHub account)

**If you want to learn Docker**: Use the Dockerfile I created

**If you're just checking if code compiles**: Replit (but can't run it)
