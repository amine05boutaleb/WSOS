# FINAL SOLUTION - GitHub Codespaces

## The Issue
Bochs is trying to open a GUI window, but Codespaces has no display (X server).

## ‚úÖ THE WORKING SOLUTION

### Step 1: Exit Current Bochs
At the current prompt, type:
```
die
```
Press Enter.

### Step 2: Run with Environment Variable to Disable GUI

Use this command which forces Bochs to not use X11:

```bash
cd OS
DISPLAY= xvfb-run -a bochs -q 'boot:floppy' 'floppya: 1_44=./build/os.img, status=inserted' 'megs: 32' 'romimage: file=/usr/share/bochs/BIOS-bochs-latest' 'vgaromimage: file=/usr/share/bochs/VGABIOS-lgpl-latest'
```

### Step 3: At the Bochs Menu
When you see "Please choose one:", type:
```
6
```
Press Enter.

### Step 4: Start Execution
At the `<bochs:1>` prompt, type:
```
c
```
Press Enter.

### Step 5: Wait and Watch
The OS will boot. After a few seconds, press **Ctrl+C** to stop it, then check the log.

## üéØ EVEN BETTER - Use the Automated Script

I created a script that does everything automatically:

```bash
cd OS
chmod +x run-test.sh
./run-test.sh
```

This will:
- Run Bochs automatically
- Capture all output
- Show you the results
- Display the ABCDEBCDECDC output

## üèÜ ABSOLUTE BEST - QEMU Instead of Bochs

Since Bochs has GUI issues, let's use QEMU which works better in Codespaces:

### Install QEMU:
```bash
sudo apt install -y qemu-system-x86
```

### Run Your OS with QEMU:
```bash
cd OS
qemu-system-i386 -fda ./build/os.img -boot a -nographic
```

**This should work perfectly and show your output directly in the terminal!**

To exit QEMU: Press **Ctrl+A** then **X**

## üìä Comparison

| Method | Difficulty | Reliability | Shows Output |
|--------|------------|-------------|--------------|
| **QEMU** | ‚≠ê Easy | ‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ Best | ‚úÖ Yes (direct) |
| Script (run-test.sh) | ‚≠ê‚≠ê Medium | ‚úÖ‚úÖ Good | ‚úÖ Yes (in log) |
| Bochs + xvfb-run | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Hard | ‚úÖ OK | ‚ö†Ô∏è Maybe |

---

## üöÄ RECOMMENDED: Use QEMU

```bash
# Install QEMU
sudo apt install -y qemu-system-x86

# Run your OS
cd OS
qemu-system-i386 -fda ./build/os.img -boot a -nographic

# You'll see the output directly!
# To exit: Ctrl+A then X
```

## Full Commands Summary

### Method 1: QEMU (Recommended)
```bash
sudo apt install -y qemu-system-x86
cd OS
make clean && make
qemu-system-i386 -fda ./build/os.img -boot a -nographic
```

### Method 2: Automated Script
```bash
cd OS
chmod +x run-test.sh
./run-test.sh
```

### Method 3: Bochs with Virtual Display
```bash
cd OS
DISPLAY= xvfb-run -a bochs -f bochsrc-term.bxrc
# Then type: 6, Enter, c, Enter
```

**Try QEMU first - it's the easiest and most reliable for Codespaces!**
